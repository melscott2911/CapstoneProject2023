# Goals of this Research
This data research project aims to present patients with evidence that supports the correlation of health insurance costs with the following attributes: BMI, smoking history, sex, age, and children. The problem I want to aim to solve is how patients can try to avoid higher health costs and make choices that could help with lowering their risk of being subject to higher insurance premiums. This discovery will be organized through process components, data extraction and cleaning, figures, and results summary.

# Description of Data
This is a structured data set in a CSV format and is made up of 7 columns and 1,338 rows.This was extracted directly from the Kaggle website and downloaded on to my local machine. No further data was extracted due to the large file size (55.63 kB) and the quality that this data brings to support my research. The columns represent the following US patient attributes that affect health insurance cost: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The last column is representa-
tive of the medical costs billed by health insurance.

# Project Implementation
1) Pick a topic of importance, creating an Overleaf account and begin re-
search on the topic.

2) Choose a reliable dataset/source that will help showcase my project

3) Take the dataset and clean it prior to running it to be analyzed.

4) Use machine learning to diagnose problems and possible solutions.

5) Take my findings and create my project layout as well as display my
results and figures to support my data.

# Conclusion
There are many factors that play into a patient's health and environment. As seen from the results extracted through my research, attributes, such as age, can be a likely factor in the increase of medical insurance costs. From these results, it can be assumed that there is a strong relationship between a patient's characteristics (BMI, sex/gender, number of children, age, smoking status, and region) and the medical costs that come with those associations. Although there is not a constant increase with one attribute and its adjacent medical cost, we can safely assume that there may pose a potential risk for an increase in cost.
# Limitations
There are vast amounts of insurance companies, medical conditions and cost
variances. This research will take only a snapshot of patient costs and does not
account for all patient attributes or conditions and should be used as a general
estimation of costs.

# Future Work
In my future work, I would like to compare other studies with similar attributes to cross-compare my results. I would also test different machine learning algorithms to attempt to get a stronger correlation between the attributes and cost factors. I also think that it would be helpful to get specific insurance company information, as costs can vary between them. These factors would present an even more compelling argument to help patients decrease health and cost risks in the future and motivate others to put their health at the forefront of importance.
